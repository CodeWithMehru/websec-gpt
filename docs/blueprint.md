# **App Name**: Twin AI

## Core Features:

- UI Replica: Pixel-perfect replication of the Gemini AI interface's overall layout and styling, including color scheme, typography, spacing, shadows, and gradients.
- Sidebar Clone: Functional sidebar with smooth collapsible animation, toggle button, chat history section, account section, and new chat button.
- Chat Interface Mirror: Exact duplication of the main chat interface, with welcome message, scrollable chat display area for user and AI messages (bubbles, formatting, etc.), and optional typing indicator.
- Input Control Replication: Accurate reproduction of the input message bar, working mic button (visual feedback only), image upload button (no actual upload), and active send button with animation.
- Fully responsive UI: The entire interface must adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A clean, modern blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and intelligence, mirroring Gemini's brand identity.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F5F5F5) for a minimalist, distraction-free canvas.
- Accent color: A soft green (#34A853) for interactive elements like the send button, indicating action and progress.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, providing a modern, neutral, and highly readable experience.
- Use icons that are either identical or very similar in style to those used in the official Gemini interface.
- Subtle animations and transitions for sidebar toggling, button hovers, and message entry, creating a polished user experience.
- Layout should precisely match the original Gemini AI layout.
